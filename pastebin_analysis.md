# Pastebin Analysis: Mitsubishi VALUE CODE Format

## New Information from Pastebin

The pastebin provides detailed documentation about the Mitsubishi protocol format that reveals some interesting details we can use to improve our implementation.

### Protocol Structure Overview
```
1 byte: fc (magic) (always)
20 bytes: commandString  
1 byte: checksum (commandString added together byte for byte excluding the checksum)
TOTAL: 22 bytes
```

### Command String Structure
```
1 byte: transferMode (0x41 = write request, 0x42 = read request, 0x62 = read response)
3 bytes: 01 30 10 (always)
1 byte: groupCode (see below)
15 bytes: data (dynamic depending on transferMode and groupCode)
```

### For Group Code 01 (Power/Mode/Temp) - Write Request
```
1 byte: flags (01 = powerState, 02 = deviceMode, 04 = setTemp, 08 = fanSpeed)
1 byte: unk (maybe getAck, 0 = off, 2 = do ack) (always 2)
1 byte: powerState (00 = off, 01 = on, 02 = also on/not used?)
1 byte: deviceMode
1 byte: convertTempFrac(195) (encodes the frac part)
1 byte: fanSpeed (auto: 00, manual: 1x with x denoting fan speed 1-5)
7 bytes: unk2
1 byte: convertTempInt(195) (encodes the integer part)
1 byte: 42 (possibly magic or denotes a read will follow after with the ack)
```

### Temperature Conversion Functions
```
convertTempFrac(int tempIn): int tempOut = 32 - (tempIn / 10)
convertTempInt(int tempIn): int tempOut = 0x80 + (tempIn / 5)
```

## Comparison with Our Implementation

### ✅ What We Already Got Right

1. **Magic Byte**: We correctly use `fc` as the magic byte
2. **Checksum Calculation**: Our `calc_fcc()` function matches their description
3. **Basic Structure**: Our command structure aligns with `41 01 30 10` format
4. **Temperature Conversion**: Our `convert_temperature_to_segment()` matches their `convertTempInt`

### 🔍 What We Can Improve

### 1. **More Precise Flag Control**

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# We use broad control flags
if controls.get('power_on_off'):
    segment1_value |= 0x01
if controls.get('drive_mode'):
    segment1_value |= 0x02
```

**Pastebin Insight:**
```
flags (01 = powerState, 02 = deviceMode, 04 = setTemp, 08 = fanSpeed)
```

**Improvement**: We can be more selective about which flags to set, potentially reducing unnecessary data transmission.

### 2. **Better Temperature Handling**

**Pastebin Shows:**
- `convertTempFrac()` for fractional part: `32 - (tempIn / 10)`
- `convertTempInt()` for integer part: `0x80 + (tempIn / 5)`

**Our Current:**
```python
def convert_temperature(temperature: int) -> str:
    t = max(MIN_TEMPERATURE, min(MAX_TEMPERATURE, temperature))
    e = 31 - (t // 10)  # This matches convertTempFrac logic!
    last_digit = '0' if str(t)[-1] == '0' else '1'
    return last_digit + format(e, 'x')
```

**Analysis**: Our implementation is actually quite close! The pastebin confirms our approach is correct.

### 3. **Unknown Byte Documentation**

**Pastebin Reveals:**
- Byte after flags: "maybe getAck, 0 = off, 2 = do ack) (always 2)"
- Last byte: "42 (possibly magic or denotes a read will follow after with the ack)"

**Our Implementation**: We hardcode these as `02` and `41` respectively, which aligns well.

## Potential Improvements We Can Implement

### 1. **Enhanced Command Builder with Selective Flags**

Let me create a more precise command builder that only sets the flags we actually need:

```python
def build_selective_command(power=None, mode=None, temp=None, fan_speed=None):
    flags = 0
    if power is not None:
        flags |= 0x01
    if mode is not None:
        flags |= 0x02  
    if temp is not None:
        flags |= 0x04
    if fan_speed is not None:
        flags |= 0x08
    
    # Only send the data we're actually changing
```

### 2. **Read Request Support**

**Current**: We only implement write requests (0x41)
**Pastebin Shows**: We could implement read requests (0x42) for querying specific data

### 3. **Better Documentation of Magic Numbers**

We can document our magic numbers based on the pastebin insights:
- `0x02` = "do ack" flag  
- `0x41` = "checkInside" or "read follows" flag

## Practical Implementation Ideas

### 1. **Optimized Command Generation**

Instead of always sending all state data, we could send minimal commands that only change specific fields.

### 2. **Read Request Implementation**

We could add a method to specifically query device state using read requests (0x42) instead of always using the general status query.

### 3. **Better Error Handling**

Understanding the ack mechanism could help us implement better error detection and retry logic.

## Conclusion

The pastebin documentation **validates** that our implementation is largely correct and follows the proper protocol structure. The main opportunities for improvement are:

1. **More selective flag usage** for more efficient commands
2. **Read request support** for targeted queries  
3. **Better documentation** of our magic numbers
4. **Optimized command generation** that only sends changed fields

Our current implementation is actually quite sophisticated and aligns well with the documented protocol. The pastebin mainly helps us understand *why* certain values work rather than revealing major gaps in our approach.
