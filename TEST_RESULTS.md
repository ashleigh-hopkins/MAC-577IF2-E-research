## Tests Performed

### ✅ Basic Control Commands (CLI)
1. **Power Control**: Successfully tested turning OFF and ON
   - Command: `python3 ac_control.py --ip 192.168.0.54 --power off`
   - Command: `python3 ac_control.py --ip 192.168.0.54 --power on`

2. **Temperature Control**: Successfully set temperature to 25°C
   - Command: `python3 ac_control.py --ip 192.168.0.54 --temp 25`

3. **Mode Control**: Successfully changed mode to HEAT
   - Command: `python3 ac_control.py --ip 192.168.0.54 --mode heat`

4. **Fan Speed Control**: Successfully set fan speed to level 3
   - Command: `python3 ac_control.py --ip 192.168.0.54 --fan-speed 3`

5. **Combined Commands**: Successfully executed multiple commands at once
   - Command: `python3 ac_control.py --ip 192.168.0.54 --mode auto --temp 23 --fan-speed 2`

### ✅ Extended Features (Python API)
1. **Vertical Vane Control (Right Side)**: Set to V2 position
2. **Vertical Vane Control (Left Side)**: Set to V3 position  
3. **Horizontal Vane Control**: Set to L (Left) position
4. **Dehumidifier Setting**: Set to 80%
5. **Power Saving Mode**: Enabled
6. **Buzzer Control**: Activated

## Command Types Used

### General Commands (Basic Control)
- Power on/off
- Temperature setting
- Mode selection
- Fan speed
- Vertical vane direction
- Horizontal vane direction

### Extend08 Commands (Advanced Features)
- Dehumidifier settings
- Power saving mode
- Buzzer control

## Response Analysis
All commands received successful responses:
- ✅ Commands were properly formatted with correct checksums
- ✅ Device acknowledged all commands
- ✅ State changes were reflected in subsequent status queries
- ✅ No error codes were returned

## State Restoration
Successfully restored the AC to its original state using the restoration script:
- All original settings were properly restored
- Final verification confirmed settings match original state
- System returned to stable operation

## Technical Implementation Success
1. **Protocol Implementation**: Hex command generation working correctly
2. **Encryption/Decryption**: AES-CBC encryption working properly
3. **XML Wrapping**: Proper XML structure for device communication
4. **Checksum Calculation**: FCC checksums computed correctly
5. **State Management**: Local state tracking functioning properly
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and reporting

## Conclusion
The Mitsubishi AC control system is fully functional and can reliably:
- Control all basic AC functions (power, temperature, mode, fan speed)
- Control advanced features (vanes, dehumidifier, power saving, buzzer)
- Maintain proper state synchronization
- Handle both CLI and programmatic interfaces
- Restore previous settings

All control commands work as expected and the AC responds appropriately to all control inputs.
